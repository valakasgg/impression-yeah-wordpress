<h1 id="yeahwordpresstheme">Yeah WordPress Theme</h1>

<p>WordPress theme created as a test for <strong>impression.studio</strong> using a simple flexible content system, allowing easy editing. CSS &amp; JS assets are managed using CodeKit which includes browsersync and the use of industry standard tools creating an enjoyable development experience.</p>

<p>I originally setup webpack in the theme folder with the aim to use Tailwind but struggled to get BrowserSync working. I decided to not waste anymore time and to use CodeKit as it works flawlessly and I&#8217;ve rarely run into issues.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used a range of JS libraries and CSS for simple animations to show what is possible. The pagination has the correct positioning but unfortunately isn&#8217;t updating and have done lots of testing with it, I can only think of using something different to get it working which would be Slick Slider.</p>

<h2 id="howitsbuilt.">How its built.</h2>

<p>The bulk of the work is done using the Advanced Custom Fields Plugin with some Addons. Utilising the Flexible Content, when a new block inside flexible-content is created, the flexible-content.php file will search for a matching component file.</p>

<p>For the animations, I&#8217;ve used simple CSS keyframes for the pulse effect, AOS JS fade in once in viewport and an advanced SVG Morph using anime.js</p>
