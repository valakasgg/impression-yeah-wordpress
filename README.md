# Yeah WordPress Theme

WordPress theme created as a test for  **impression.studio** using a simple flexible content system, allowing easy editing. CSS & JS assets are managed using CodeKit which includes browsersync and the use of industry standard tools creating an enjoyable development experience.

I originally setup webpack in the theme folder with the aim to use Tailwind but struggled to get BrowserSync working. I decided to not waste anymore time and to use CodeKit as it works flawlessly and I've rarely run into issues.

I've used a range of JS libraries and CSS for simple animations to show what is possible. The only negative is that the pagination isn't working at this present time which I apolgise about.
