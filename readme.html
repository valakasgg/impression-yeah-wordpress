<h1 id="yeahwordpresstheme">Yeah WordPress Theme</h1>

<p>WordPress theme created as a test for <strong>impression.studio</strong> using a simple flexible content system, allowing easy editing. CSS &amp; JS assets are managed using CodeKit which includes browsersync and the use of industry standard tools creating an enjoyable development experience.</p>

<p>I originally setup webpack in the theme folder with the aim to use Tailwind but struggled to get BrowserSync working. I decided to not waste anymore time and to use CodeKit as it works flawlessly and I&#8217;ve rarely run into issues.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used a range of JS libraries and CSS for simple animations to show what is possible. The only negative is that the pagination isn&#8217;t working at this present time which I apolgise about.</p>
